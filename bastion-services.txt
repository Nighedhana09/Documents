Azure bastion ----- acts as a protection(layer) services

1. It is fully managed paas inside your VN
2. Provides secured and seamless rdp/ssh connection to VM's
---- open the VM through public browser instead of direct rdp/ssh connection
3. eliminates the need of Pubic ip address


4. Create subnet for bastion service with the name AzureBastionSubnet
5. we can access VM in the browser using Bastion service

Note :

1. Other than bastion service, no resource can be deployed in AzureBastionSubnet
2. To remove public ip dissociate from virtual machine.
3. To use same bastion service for multiple VM, try peering.

Steps to create bastion service

1. Create resource-group
2. create Virtual network
3. Create subnet with the name AzureBastionSubnet
4. serach for bastion and create new bastion
5. select the required info (rg,vnet,sub-net)
6. select create new public-ip (if we have multiple VM's, bastion creates Public-ip to connect with target machine) 
7. review and create
8. create Virtual machine (choose password method and select all the in`bound ports http,https,ssh)
9. review and create
10.Go to VM and click on "connect"
11. Select "Bastion" and Provide the username and password
12. click on "connect"


Drawbacks
1. Costly
2. takes atleast 5-20 mins to deploy
(beacuse it scans our virtual network)
